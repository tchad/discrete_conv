This is an updatec C implementation of the FFT algorithm.
Changes:
    - Fixed indexing
    - Changed the sorting of final layer output. Now it uses bit reversal to establish correct index of an output element.
    - Readig input data from text file, the path to file must be given at runtime as an argument.
    ex: ./fft data.in data.cplxfft 17

    ARGS:
     1 - source file path
     2 - dest file path
     3 - size of array expressed as N=log2(array size), MUST BE whole number == array size = 2^N
